# RtspSrv_Qt5


A Rtsp streamimg server with Qt-based Gui.

This server read and parses AVI file with FFmpeg ,movie clips which combined with H264 and mp3 ES, and streams to local network.

I add a Qt-based Gui to display some information of the srever,

and make this rtsp server to do a none-stop( or something likes gap-less between one clip to next one) infinition loop
playing all playlist defined movie clips.

this project is used in city bus advertise system, also high-way and lift advertise system.
